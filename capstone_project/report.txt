DESCRIPTION
MY  PROJECT AIMS TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS BASED ON PATTERNS FOUND IN PAST SPORT DATA.
THE ANALYSIS TARGETS FITNESS-ORIENTATED FIRMS IN HOPES OF HELPING THEM UNDERSTAND KEY INSIGHTS ABOUT HOW TO ATTRACT AND MAINTAIN THEIR CLIENT BASE
MY AUDIENCE FOR THIS PROJECT WOULD NOT BE LIMITED TO FITNESS ORGANISATIONS, BUT ALSO SPORTS PLAYERS AND FITNESS COUCHES AS WELL AS ORDIANRY PUBLIC USE.

WHICH CLIENT DID YOU SELECT AND WHY?
I CHOSE THE SPORTS STATS CLIENT SINCE I HAVE A STRONG INTEREST IN SPORTS AND FITNESS AND WANTED TO DEVELOP MEANINGFUL INSIGHTS AND PATTERNS ABOUT DIFFERENT SPORTS.
DESCRIBE THE STEPS YOU TOOK TO IMPORT AND CLEAN THE DATA.
I IMPORTED THE DATA USING DATABRICKS BY FIRST ATTACHING  TO MY CLUSTER, THEN MOUNTING THE DATA AND CREATING A  DATABASE AND TABLE .
SINCE THE DATASET HAS NAN VALUES, I DID NOT TAKE ANY STEPS TO CLEAN THE DATA AS THAT WOULD BE FALSIFICATION OF DATA.


--QUESTION 1 : IS THERE A CORRELATION BETWEEN AGE AND AWARDS WON?
--HYPOTHESIS : THE OLDER THEY PLAYER, THE HIGHER THE PROBABLITY THAT THEY HAVE A MEDAL, AND THAT PROBABLITY WILL DECREASE WITH THE AGE OF THE PLAYER.
--APPROACH : I first wanted to filter out any null values in the medal column. I then wanted to generate a count of how many medals were won 
in general and to then plot them against age.


SELECT age,
       SUM(CASE
             WHEN medal == 'NA' THEN 0
             ELSE 1
           END) AS sum_medal_for_age
FROM   ae
GROUP  BY age
ORDER  BY age; 

--CONCLUSION : The data seems to follow a normal distribution which suggests that players who are in the age range of 19 to 30 have won the most medals which proves 
the initial hypothesis.

--QUESTION 2 : WHICH COUNTRY HAS WON THE MOST MEDALS?
--HYPOTHESIS : THE COUNTRY WITH THE MOST PLAYERS HAS THE MOST MEDALS.
--APPROACH : I first wanted to filter out any null values in the medal column. I then wanted to generate a count of how many people were in each region 
in general and to then plot them against the number of people who won medals in that region.


SELECT Count(id) AS player_count,
       SUM(CASE
             WHEN medal == 'NA' THEN 1
             ELSE 0
           END)  AS sum_medal_for_region,
       r.region
FROM   ae
       left join r
              ON ae.noc = r.noc
GROUP  BY r.region
ORDER  BY player_count DESC 

--CONCLUSION : The data seems to follow a inear pattern which suggests that the countries with the most players also have the most medals, which proves the initial
hypothesis.

--QUESTION 3 : IS THERE A CORRELATION BETWEEN GENDER AND SPORT? 
--HYPOTHESIS : THERE ARE MORE MEN THAN WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN SPORTS.
--APPROACH : I fist generated a count of how many people of each gender played each sport and plotted them against 
each other.

SELECT sport,
       Sum(CASE
             WHEN sex == 'M' THEN 1
             ELSE 0
           end) AS male_count,
       Sum(CASE
             WHEN sex == 'F' THEN 1
             ELSE 0
           end) AS female_count
FROM   ae
GROUP  BY sport
ORDER  BY male_count DESC,
          female_count DESC
LIMIT  100

--CONCLUSION : The data seems to suggest that the hypothesis indeed true, more men participate in certain sports.

--QUESTION 4 : IS THERE A CORRELATION BETWEEN BMI AND WHETHER OR NOT A PLAYER HAS A MEDAL?
--HYPOTHESIS : THERE IS A CORRELATION.
--APPROACH : I fist filter out all the null values for height and weight, then computed the BMI for each player, then checked to see if they have won an award.

SELECT medal,
       Round(( weight / height / height ) * 10000, 1) AS BMI
FROM   ae
WHERE  weight != 'NA'
       AND height != 'NA'
       AND medal != 'NA'
GROUP  BY medal,
          BMI
ORDER  BY BMI DESC 

--CONCLUSION : The data seems to suggest that the hypothesis indeed true.

--QUESTION 5 : DOES THE BMI FOR MALE ATHLETES FOLLOW A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION?
--HYPOTHESIS : YES
--APPROACH : I fist filter out all the null values for height and weight, then computed the BMI for each male player.

WITH cte AS
(
       SELECT sex,
              Round((weight/height/height) * 10000,1) AS BMI
       FROM   ae
       WHERE  weight != 'NA'
       AND    height != 'NA' )
SELECT   BMI,
         sum(
         CASE
                  WHEN sex == 'M' THEN 1
                  ELSE 0
         END) AS male_count
FROM     cte
GROUP BY sex,
         BMI
ORDER BY male_count DESC limit 100


--CONCLUSION : The hypothesis seems to be correct.

NEXT STEPS
FITNESS-ORIENTATED FIRMS CAN TAKE THESE INSIGHTS AND STRATGISE THEIR PRODUCT LAUNCHES TO GEAR TOWARDS THEIR TARGET MARKET.
FOR EXAMPLE: 
CREATING A MARKETING CAMPAIGN THAT USES THE BMI DATA TO PROMOTE THEIR PRODUCT TO THEIR HEALTH CONSCIENCE CLIENT BASE .
FITNESS COUCHES ADJUSTING THEIR PLAYERSâ€™ TRAINING PROGRAM TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT GENDER AND AGE.
